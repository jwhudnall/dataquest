    "### Measuring the Execution Time\n",
    "On this screen, we're going to learn how to measure the execution time of a Python function. Ultimately, our goal is not to measure the time of a specific execution of an algorithm, but rather to analyze the algorithm and predict how the execution time will evolve as data grows larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the more data an algorithm needs to process, the more time it will take to run. What we are interested in is building a model that tells us by how much the execution time grows as we increase the amount of data. We call these models the time complexity of an algorithm. By analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm, we want to be able to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we double the data, do we double the execution time, do we quadruple it, or something else entirely?*\n",
