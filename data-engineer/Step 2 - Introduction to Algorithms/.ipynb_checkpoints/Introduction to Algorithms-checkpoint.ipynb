    "### Measuring the Execution Time\n",
    "On this screen, we're going to learn how to measure the execution time of a Python function. Ultimately, our goal is not to measure the time of a specific execution of an algorithm, but rather to analyze the algorithm and predict how the execution time will evolve as data grows larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the more data an algorithm needs to process, the more time it will take to run. What we are interested in is building a model that tells us by how much the execution time grows as we increase the amount of data. We call these models the time complexity of an algorithm. By analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm, we want to be able to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we double the data, do we double the execution time, do we quadruple it, or something else entirely?*\n",

If their length was to change later, the next positions might already be used by other variables, and data would be lost.\n",

In order to be sure about our answer, we need to look at every single element in the list. If we stop before inspecting all list elements, we can never know whether the target was located at one of the indexes that we did not check.\n",

    "Now that we understand how to reason about finding an integer within a sorted list, let's build an algorithm that plays that game for us. When we played to find the index of 42, we ended up with a fixed set of ask() commands that work for value 42 only:\n",

    "What we want to do now is something more general. We want to build a function that, given a value, automatically asks the right questions to quickly find the index of that value in a sorted list. For this, we will generalize our thought process. The high-level idea is the following:\n",

    "1. Keep track of the range of possible indexes where the answer can be.\n",
