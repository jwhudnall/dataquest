    "### Measuring the Execution Time\n",
    "On this screen, we're going to learn how to measure the execution time of a Python function. Ultimately, our goal is not to measure the time of a specific execution of an algorithm, but rather to analyze the algorithm and predict how the execution time will evolve as data grows larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the more data an algorithm needs to process, the more time it will take to run. What we are interested in is building a model that tells us by how much the execution time grows as we increase the amount of data. We call these models the time complexity of an algorithm. By analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm, we want to be able to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we double the data, do we double the execution time, do we quadruple it, or something else entirely?*\n",

If their length was to change later, the next positions might already be used by other variables, and data would be lost.\n",

    "We learned in the previous mission that accessing the value of a specific list index can be done in constant time. In order to be sure about our answer, we need to look at every single element in the list. If we stop before inspecting all list elements, we can never know whether the target was located at one of the indexes that we did not check.\n",

    "In our previous example, if we stop early â€” say, at 8 â€” we will incorrectly conclude that 5 is not present. There is no way of avoiding having to look at all values to be sure about the answer.\n",

    "Of course, we could be lucky and find the element in the first few indexes. But remember that time complexity is about the worst case. In the worst case, the element is not there or is the last element that we check. In any of those cases, there is no way around looking at every single index.\n",

    "We saw that we cannot do better than O(N), and that O(N) was achievable by the above contains_value() function. Therefore, we say that the contains_value() has optimal time complexity. In most cases, it is not easy to prove that an algorithm has ***optimal time complexity***. In general, we have algorithms for solving problems but have not idea whether or not a better algorithm exists.\n",
