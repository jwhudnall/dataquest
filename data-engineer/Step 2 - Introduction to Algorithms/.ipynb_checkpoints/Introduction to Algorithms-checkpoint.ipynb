For example, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that, given a list of values, outputs that same list of values but rearranges them in increasing (or decreasing) order.\n",

    "### Measuring the Execution Time\n",
    "On this screen, we're going to learn how to measure the execution time of a Python function. Ultimately, our goal is not to measure the time of a specific execution of an algorithm, but rather to analyze the algorithm and predict how the execution time will evolve as data grows larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the more data an algorithm needs to process, the more time it will take to run. What we are interested in is building a model that tells us by how much the execution time grows as we increase the amount of data. We call these models the time complexity of an algorithm. By analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm, we want to be able to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we double the data, do we double the execution time, do we quadruple it, or something else entirely?*\n",

If their length was to change later, the next positions might already be used by other variables, and data would be lost.\n",

    "As we can see, the cost of appending an element to a list is always between 2N and 3N. Since it's always smaller than 3N and 3N = O(N), this means the cost of appending N elements to a list is O(N).\n",

    "Since N operations cost O(N) , we can amortize the cost of a single operation by dividing the total cost by the number of operations. In this case, by dividing O(N) by N we get O(N) / N = O(1) for each list.append(). We then say that list.append() has **amortized complexity** of O(1).\n",

    "Because of this, <u>**we should only use lists when the operations that we need to use on the data are limited to list.append(), list.pop(), and looping over all list elements**</u>. If we need more complex operations, odds are that there is a more efficient data structure for storing the data."
